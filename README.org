** installation

        1) installing npm

           - you must install npm to build and run this project

             - the command is usually `sudo apt install npm', `sudo dnf install npm' or `sudo pacman -S npm'

               - if your package manager is different to this, you know how to install stuff

               - if you're on windows, you're on your own :/

** running / testing

        1) cd into the base of the git directory and run `npm dev run'
